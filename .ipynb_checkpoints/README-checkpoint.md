## What is this?
The NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission Data Pipeline is a series of data processing steps. The pipeline computationally ingests data at the pipeline's beginning. Then there are a series of steps in which each step delivers an output that is the input to the next step. This process continues until the pipeline is complete. In some cases, independent efforts run in parallel.

This data pipeline consists of three key elements: a source, a processing step or steps, and a destination (a sink). The data pipeline enables data to flow from an application to a data warehouse (MS Azure) for future analytics and report generations.


## How to use this?
This data pipeline is architected as a batch-based flow. In this architecture scenario, we have built an Extraction Transformation Load (ETL) flow from the New York Taxi & Limousine Commission data sets to push this data to a data warehouse and an analytics database.


## How to test this?
This project's engineering effort utilizes test-driven development (TDD) processes that rely on repetitive short development cycles. To ensure code quality, the development team will write a test that initially fails the automated test case. This test case defines a desired outcome or improvement for a new-found function, then generates the minimum extent of code to pass that test. 
The testing procedure will follow the below sequence of steps:
1.	Add a test
2.	Run every test and validate if the new test fails
3.	Write some code
4.	Run tests
5.	Refactor code
6.	Repeat


## Constraints, Limitations, Assumptions

__Question 1.__ Data sources you are considering for your open-ended capstone?  

Data: New York Taxi & Limousine Commission data set.
Link: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page

__Question 2.__ Volume available of data for each source (historic and delta)? 

The historical load comprises the below-archived file sets for each month of the year since 2009, totaling around 288 gigabytes. The complementary delta loads occur each month and increment the data set by at least 2 gigabytes in total. 

__Delta Load (2 gigabytes per month):__
* Yellow Taxi Trip Records (CSV): file size – 579,698 KB
* Green Taxi Trip Records (CSV): file size – 39,744 KB
* For-Hire Vehicle Trip Records (CSV) – 108,186 KB
* High Volume For-Hire Vehicle Trip Records (CSV) – 1,273,342 KB

__Historical Load (288 gigabytes):__
* Yellow Taxi Trip Records (CSV): file size – 83,476,512 KB
* Green Taxi Trip Records (CSV): file size – 5,723,136 KB
* For-Hire Vehicle Trip Records (CSV) – 15,578,784 KB
* High Volume For-Hire Vehicle Trip Records (CSV) – 183,361,248 KB

__Question 3.__ The volume you will be using for your capstone? 

As of December 2020, I plan on utilizing all 288 gigabytes of the Historical Load, and I will delta load the new storage location by the number of months from December to the month when the capstone is due. 

__Question 4.__ Why do you think this is a good data source to be used for the capstone? 

I believe this is a good data source as the data is extensive and has large delta loads that are still active and will help people analyze the end product versus spending time wrangling the data itself. 

__Project Pros & Cons:__

Pros
-	As of December 2020, the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission's actively maintains the file sets and protect them under the Freedom Of Information Law (FOIL).
-	The U.S. NYC Government is transparent in sharing this information with the general public.

Cons
-	There is no API built for the data sets, and several folders partition the data sets out by year and month.
-	The file format is in .csv, and there may be risks associated with file corruption.  

We will use this project management model to ensure that the client can save time and money throughout the process and have the flexibility to make changes anytime during the development process. 


## Project Setup

The NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission, Data Engineering Project, will use the Agile Methodology as the project management process. The methodology involves breaking down each project into prioritized requirements and delivering each piece within an iterative cycle. Each iteration is evaluated and assessed (sprint retrospective) by the development team and the client (Springboard Mentor). The insights gained from the retrospective determines development next steps. We set clear goals in each iteration meeting during the retrospective, such as; expected changes, time estimates, priorities, and budgets.

The agile method gives high priority to client participation at the project's initiation and throughout its lifecycle. The intention is to keep the client involved at every step and to incrementally create a product that they are satisfied with at the end. This approach is essential in saving the client money and time because the client tests and approves the work at each development step, quickly making changes if needed. 

__Project Setup Goals:__

-	Clarifying needs and outcomes and connecting them to small-behaviors and straightforward
-	Breaking down broad overwhelming goals into smaller objectives
-	Troubleshooting what is not working well
-	Learning from what is working well
-	Finding ways to get started easier
-	Diminishing the risk of harmful unintentional outcomes
-	Illuminating the standards for success and expanding the definition of success to include a more comprehensive range of acceptability when learning.
-	Examining your progress in a way that encourages continued progress and emphasizes recovering from setbacks over fearing and avoiding them (self-coaching and self-leading.)
